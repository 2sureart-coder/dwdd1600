        <h2>Our Mission</h2>
        <p>Our mission is to help listeners connect with indie artists through <em>intentional listening</em>. 
           We believe music discovery should be meaningful, not algorithm-fed noise.</p>

        <h2>The Indie Community</h2>
        <p>The indie community thrives because of artists who take risks, support each other, and create sounds 
           outside the mainstream. Many artists fund their own projects, design their own visuals, and build 
           fan communities from the ground up.</p>

        <h2>Why It Matters</h2>
        <p>We highlight artists who use music to explore identity, emotion, and creative expression. 
           Indie music encourages listeners to slow down, reflect, and engage deeply with sound.</p>

        <p>Our work is fueled by passion, storytelling, and a desire to uplift independent creators.</p>
